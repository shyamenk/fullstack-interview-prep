# OOPs Concepts

## Overview

Object-Oriented Programming concepts, SOLID principles, design patterns, and clean architecture fundamentals for interview preparation.

## Study Checklist

### Four Pillars of OOP
- [ ] Encapsulation - Bundling data with methods, hiding internal state
- [ ] Abstraction - Hiding complexity, showing only essentials
- [ ] Inheritance - Code reuse through parent-child relationships
- [ ] Polymorphism - Same interface, different behaviors

### SOLID Principles
- [ ] **S**ingle Responsibility - One class, one reason to change
- [ ] **O**pen/Closed - Open for extension, closed for modification
- [ ] **L**iskov Substitution - Subtypes must be substitutable for base types
- [ ] **I**nterface Segregation - Many small interfaces over one large
- [ ] **D**ependency Inversion - Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Design Patterns
- [ ] Singleton - One instance, global access
- [ ] Factory - Delegate object creation
- [ ] Observer - Pub/sub notification system
- [ ] Strategy - Swappable algorithms at runtime

### Clean Architecture
- [ ] Layer separation (Domain, Application, Infrastructure)
- [ ] Dependency rule (inward-pointing dependencies)
- [ ] Framework independence

## Quick Reference

| Concept | Key Idea |
|---------|----------|
| Encapsulation | Hide data, expose methods |
| Abstraction | Show "what", hide "how" |
| Inheritance | Child gets parent's features |
| Polymorphism | Same call, different behavior |
| SRP | One job per class |
| OCP | Extend, don't modify |
| LSP | Subtypes are substitutable |
| ISP | Small, focused interfaces |
| DIP | Depend on abstractions |
