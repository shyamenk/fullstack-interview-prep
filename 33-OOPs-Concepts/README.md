# OOPs Concepts

## Overview

Object-Oriented Programming concepts, SOLID principles, design patterns, and clean architecture fundamentals for interview preparation.

## Study Checklist

### Four Pillars of OOP
- [ ] Encapsulation - Bundling data with methods, hiding internal state
- [ ] Abstraction - Hiding complexity, showing only essentials
- [ ] Inheritance - Code reuse through parent-child relationships
- [ ] Polymorphism - Same interface, different behaviors

### SOLID Principles
- [ ] **S**ingle Responsibility - One class, one reason to change
- [ ] **O**pen/Closed - Open for extension, closed for modification
- [ ] **L**iskov Substitution - Subtypes must be substitutable for base types
- [ ] **I**nterface Segregation - Many small interfaces over one large
- [ ] **D**ependency Inversion - Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Design Patterns
- [ ] Singleton - One instance, global access
- [ ] Factory - Delegate object creation
- [ ] Observer - Pub/sub notification system
- [ ] Strategy - Swappable algorithms at runtime

### Clean Architecture
- [ ] Layer separation (Domain, Application, Infrastructure)
- [ ] Dependency rule (inward-pointing dependencies)
- [ ] Framework independence

### Advanced OOP & Patterns
- [ ] Composition over Inheritance
- [ ] Abstract Classes vs Interfaces
- [ ] Dependency Injection (DI)
- [ ] Association / Aggregation / Composition
- [ ] Cohesion vs Coupling
- [ ] Builder, Prototype, Decorator, Adapter Patterns
- [ ] Facade, Proxy, Command, Template Method Patterns
- [ ] Null Object Pattern & Law of Demeter
- [ ] Static vs Dynamic Binding

## Quick Reference

| Concept | Key Idea |
|---------|----------|
| Encapsulation | Hide data, expose methods |
| Abstraction | Show "what", hide "how" |
| Inheritance | Child gets parent's features |
| Polymorphism | Same call, different behavior |
| SRP | One job per class |
| OCP | Extend, don't modify |
| LSP | Subtypes are substitutable |
| ISP | Small, focused interfaces |
| DIP | Depend on abstractions |
| Composition | "Has-a" > "Is-a" for flexibility |
| Interface | Contract of behavior (Can-do) |
| DI | Inject dependencies, don't create them |
| Cohesion | Focused internal logic (High is good) |
| Coupling | Dependency between modules (Low is good) |
| Builder | Step-by-step object construction |
| Singleton | One instance globally |
| Factory | Delegate object creation |
| Observer | Pub/sub notification system |
| Strategy | Swappable algorithms |
| Decorator | Add features dynamically (wrapper) |
| Adapter | Make incompatible interfaces work |
| Facade | Simplified interface to complex system |
| Proxy | Control access to an object |
