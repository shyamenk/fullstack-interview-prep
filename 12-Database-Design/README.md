# Database Design

## Overview

Database fundamentals, design decisions, SQL vs NoSQL, transactions, constraints, and data integrity concepts.

## Study Checklist

### Database Fundamentals
- [ ] Transactions (ACID)
- [ ] Atomicity
- [ ] Consistency
- [ ] Isolation
- [ ] Durability
- [ ] Throughput and performance
- [ ] Constraints (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK, etc.)
- [ ] Data integrity (Entity, Referential, Domain)

### Design Decisions
- [ ] SQL vs NoSQL
- [ ] When to use relational databases
- [ ] When to use document stores
- [ ] When to use key-value stores
- [ ] Hybrid architectures

### Advanced Topics
- [ ] Indexing strategies
- [ ] Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)
- [ ] Denormalization for performance
- [ ] Sharding and partitioning
- [ ] Replication strategies

## Quick Reference

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| Transaction | Group of operations that succeed or fail together |
| Atomicity | All-or-nothing execution |
| Throughput | Operations per second |
| Constraint | Rule that restricts data |
| Integrity | Data accuracy and consistency |
| SQL | Structured, relational, ACID |
| NoSQL | Flexible, scalable, eventual consistency |
