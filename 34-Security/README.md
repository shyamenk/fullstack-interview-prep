# Security

## Overview

Security best practices, authentication, authorization, data protection, and compliance for backend applications.

## Study Checklist

### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Authentication vs Authorization
- [ ] JWT vs Sessions/Cookies
- [ ] Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- [ ] OAuth 2.0 / SSO

### Input Security
- [ ] Validation vs Sanitization
- [ ] XSS Prevention
- [ ] SQL Injection Prevention
- [ ] CSRF Protection

### Data Protection
- [ ] Encryption at rest (AES-256)
- [ ] Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3)
- [ ] Password hashing (bcrypt, Argon2)
- [ ] Secure key management

### Compliance
- [ ] HIPAA compliance requirements
- [ ] Audit logging
- [ ] Data retention policies
- [ ] GDPR basics

## Quick Reference

| Topic | Key Concept |
|-------|-------------|
| Authentication | Who are you? (JWT, sessions) |
| Authorization | What can you do? (RBAC, permissions) |
| Validation | Reject bad input |
| Sanitization | Clean dangerous input |
| Encryption at rest | AES-256 for stored data |
| Encryption in transit | TLS 1.3 for network data |
| RBAC | Roles have permissions |
| Audit Logging | Track all PHI access |
